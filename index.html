    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am on an adventure to start my career. After high school, I decided to get my AA at Columbia Basin College. It only took me approximately 6 years.. It was perhaps the best decision of my life because it showed me what I actually wanted to do with my life.</p>
    <p>Fall of 2018, I started going to Eastern Washington University, and began studying in their Visual Communication Design program, while also working on getting a UX certificate.</p>

    <h2>More About Me</h2>
    <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
    <p> I enjoy philosophy, snowboarding, and arguing with friends and family on my spare time. I have been learning to code for about six months now and it has consumed me. My appreciation for code grows everyday.</p>
    <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
    <p>My dream is to work in Front-end Development. I would also like to try my hand at Java and Android development later down the road.</p>
    <h3>Where do you work?</h3>
    <p>After three years since graduating High School, I am still working at River Island Country Club in the lower Sierra Navada foothills. I am a cart attendant during the week and a waiter by weekend. </p>
